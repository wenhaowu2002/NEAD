# NEAD
National Emergy Accounting Database V3.0
The National Environmental Accounting Database (NEAD), compiles detailed information for over 200 countries/regions for the full array of resources that underlie economies, including environmental flows (sunlight, rainfall), natural capital stocks (soil, water, forests, fish), mined materials (metals, fuels) and economically transformed goods and services (agricultural commodities, manufactured goods, services).Data for commodities and trade flows are from 2000-2014, and long-term average data are used for climate and hydrology flows.

We are now updating NEAD, and we may expect an early finish in around October 2023 and transfer onto Github in around December 2023. Keep checking this page for new activities.
