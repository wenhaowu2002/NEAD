# NEAD
National Emergy Accounting Database V3.0
The National Environmental Accounting Database (NEAD), compiles detailed information for over 200 countries/regions for the full array of resources that underlie economies, including environmental flows (sunlight, rainfall), natural capital stocks (soil, water, forests, fish), mined materials (metals, fuels) and economically transformed goods and services (agricultural commodities, manufactured goods, services). Data for commodities and trade flows are from 2000-2014, and long-term average data are used for climate and hydrology flows. More: http://www.emergy-nead.com/home
# Coding for NEAD
The general idea of Coding for NEAD is that the huge amount of data (over 150 GB) needs to be converted into a state where future updates will be able to be completed with high robustness and easy operations. Currently, we plan to upgrade it by combining Python and SQL to realize the smart computing of emergy flows. 
# Notice
We are now still updating NEAD itself with the final stage of data stabilization and post-processing, and we may expect an early finish around October 2023 and transfer onto GitHub around December 2023. Keep checking this page for new activities.
